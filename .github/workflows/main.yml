      # The retation of artifcats in GitHub isn't important after deployed to
      # Firebase. Moreover, the free storage plan here is very low and just
      # after a few weeks of development it's above the threshold. That said,
      # deleting artifacts here is a matter cost by preventing to be double billed
      # for storage in GitHub and Firebase.
